**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice Repository**

Welcome to my DSA Practice Repository!
This repository contains all the essential Data Structures and Algorithms topics that I’m learning and practicing to strengthen my problem-solving and programming skills.

Each topic is covered with concept explanations, solved problems, and optimized Java implementations (along with time and space complexity analysis).

**Language Used**

All implementations are done in Java, focusing on:
1. Clean and structured code
2. Detailed comments
3. Proper use of time and space complexities

**Objective**

The goal of this repository is to:
1. Build a strong foundation in DSA
2. Prepare for technical interviews
3. Practice problem-solving patterns
4. Understand core algorithmic techniques

**Repository Structure**

Each folder corresponds to one topic, containing all the questions required.
